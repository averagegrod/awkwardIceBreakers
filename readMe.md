This is a fun little program to pull out at a staff meeting. 

Edit js/iceBreaker.js file with your team member names and the ice breakers you'd like to use. Load up index.html, click the button, and watch everyone squirm. 

This project requires jquery. I've included a minified version because I couldn't hit a CDN from my work.

Have fun with this. I'm not responsible if you end up in your local HR office.

The names in this demo are made up to protect the ID of my real life coworkers.
